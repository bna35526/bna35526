<H4>Listed above are some little things you can do in order to become more sustainable when looking and</h4>
<H4>shopping for clothes. Buying from sustainable companies such as Everlane and Patagonia ensures that </h4>
<H4>the process of making your clothes was in a sustainable ways. Whereas shopping at stores such as H&M,</h4>
<H4>Forever21, and Zara ensures that your products were mass produced and therefore not sustainable.</h4>
<H4>Slow fashion is sustainable fashion and fast fashion is not sustainable. Getting clothes from the thrift</h4>
<H4>stores allows you to further the life clothes rather than them getting thrown away. The longer the</h4>
<H4>clothes lifespan the more sustainable is it. Buying only the clothes that you need is another great</h4>
<H4>sustainable action. Over consuming leads to clothes being thrown away and companies continuing to</h4>
<H4>mass produce. In terms of sustainability less is more and durability is the way to go. Think before you</h4>
<H4>shop, become more of a conscious shopper, and use the buyerachy of needs.</h4>

<H4>As you can see above there are various sustainable and non sustainable actions you can do on a daily</h4>
<H4>Basis such as recyling!I know for the University of Georgia campus you are able to recycle at every trash can</H4>
<H4>so I would advise that you take you time and seperate your trash in order to be more sustainable and help the planet.</h4>
<H4> Other way is to reuse products instead of just throwing them away. See if you can find mutiple uses out of your<h4>
<H4> products. There is always opportunity to optimize your products and reduce your carbon footprint on the planet.<h4>
<H4> Now for the being non sutainable, you can see that overconsuming is not the way to go because it contributes<h4>
<H4> to large landfills that are all throughout the country. People buy way too much and end up throwning things away<h4>
<H4> or people will sadly by alot which increases demand and causes stores to over produce. Either way doing too much of anything<h4>
<H4> is horrible for the environment. Lastly fast fashion companies such as Zara and Forever21 are huge factors to<h4>
<H4> unsustainable living and the decrease in the overall well being of the environment.</h4>
