<H1> What is Sustainable Fashion?</h1>
<H4>Sustainable Fashion is fashion that does little to no harm to the environment.</h4>
<H4>This means the companies are making conscious efforts to reduce the impacts </h4>
<H4>they have on the environment by strategically planning to ensure they make </h4>
<H4>the least amount of impact as possible. They do things such as using </h4>
<H4>recycled materials and fabrics, plant based dyes, and disposing on wastes </h4>
<H4>in a way that does not pollute the water systems.  Everlane, Patagonia, </h4>
<H4>and Siizu are a few examples of sustainable fashion brands. This companies</h4>
<H4>have done a very good job of informing the public about their clothing making process.</h4>
<H4>They pride themselves in making quality products that will last throughout the years</h4>
<H4>for their customers. Making lasting products makes it so that the customer does not </h4>
<H4>have to constantly buy clothing products and have to throw away their clothes that</h4>
<H4>will eventually end up in landfills. Clothes that end up in the landfills pollutes the environment.</h4>
